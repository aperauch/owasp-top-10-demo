# OWASP Top 10 Security Vulnerabilities Demo

A Next.js educational web application that demonstrates the OWASP Top 10 security vulnerabilities through interactive examples and explanations. This tool is designed for both technical and non-technical audiences to learn about web application security threats and defensive measures.

## üéØ Purpose

This application serves as:
- **Educational Tool**: Learn about the most critical web application security risks
- **WAF Testing Platform**: Test your Web Application Firewall (WAF) configuration with real attack patterns
- **Security Training**: Understand how vulnerabilities work and how to prevent them
- **Reference Guide**: Access secure coding best practices and mitigation strategies

## üîí Featured OWASP Top 10 (2021)

The application covers all 10 vulnerabilities with interactive demonstrations:

1. **A01:2021 - Broken Access Control** - Authorization bypass and privilege escalation
2. **A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures** - Weak encryption and data exposure
3. **A03:2021 - Injection** - SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
4. **A04:2021 - Insecure Design** - Design flaws and missing security controls
5. **A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration** - Insecure defaults and configurations
6. **A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components** - Component vulnerabilities
7. **A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures** - Weak authentication
8. **A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Integrity verification issues
9. **A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** - Insufficient monitoring
10. **A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** - Internal service attacks

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build

## üîç WAF Testing

This application is specifically designed to help test WAF configurations. Each vulnerability demonstration includes:

- **Attack Payloads**: Real-world attack strings and patterns
- **Detection Rules**: Suggested WAF rules and patterns to detect attacks
- **Testing Scenarios**: Specific test cases for WAF validation

### Example Test Payloads

**SQL Injection:**
```
' OR '1'='1' --
' UNION SELECT * FROM users --
'; DROP TABLE users; --
```

**XSS:**
```
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
javascript:alert('XSS')
```

**SSRF:**
```
http://localhost:8080/admin
http://127.0.0.1:22
http://169.254.169.254/metadata
```
